Title: Welcome Everyone!

Before he was one of the highest paid actors of all time,
appearing in movies such as Jungle Fever and Do the Right Thing,
Star Wars and The Avengers, Samuel L. Jackson was born in Washington D.C. in 1948,
and spent the majority of his childhood raised by his grandmother in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
He idolized film-making and movies since he was a child,
going to the movie theater near where he lived quite often.
